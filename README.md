Part of the course ES323 - Control Systems project.

# instructions:
1. start the system simulator: `python3 system.py [bob|ship|maglev|bicopter]`.
Specifying the type of system to simulate is mandatory.
1. start, in a new command window, the controller, who implements the communication with the simulated system and matlab: `python3 controller.py [tcp_port]` 
Students should only adapt the class `Controller`. This class takes the measurement `y` and produces the system input `u`.
1. add the folder `matlab_tools` to the matlab path and run the matlab script:
    * connect to `controller.py` with `arduino = tcpclient('localhost', tcp_port);`
    * set mode and reference value with `set_mode_params(arduino, mode, w, [])` where `mode` can be either `OPEN_LOOP`, `CLASSICAL` or `STATE_SPACE`. These same modes should also be defined in `Controller`.
    * get a response of the system with `[y, u] = get_response(arduino, w, n_samples)` where `y` are the measurements and `u` is the system input (generated by the controller).
