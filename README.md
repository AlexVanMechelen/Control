# Part of the course ES323 - Control Systems project.

## Requirements:
* matlab
* python 3 (preferably 3.6, although 3.7 might work too but hasn't been tested)
* matplotlib (for visualization)

## General instructions:
1. download the files, either with `git clone` (preferred) or by downloading all the files in zip format (choose `Clone or download` in the top right corner)
1. Unzip the files (if needed). Open a command window and `cd` into the newly created directory.
1. Start the system simulator: `python3 system.py [bob|ship|maglev|bicopter]`.
Specifying the type of system to simulate is mandatory.
1. Start, in a new command window, the controller which implements the communication with the simulated system and matlab: `python3 controller.py [tcp_port]`. 
Students should only adapt the class `Controller`. This class takes the measurement `y` and produces the system input `u`.
1. add the folder `matlab_tools` to the matlab path and run the matlab script:
    * connect to `controller.py` with `arduino = tcpclient('localhost', tcp_port);`
    * set mode and reference value with `set_mode_params(arduino, mode, w, [])` where `mode` can be either `OPEN_LOOP`, `CLASSICAL` or `STATE_SPACE`. These same modes should also be defined in `Controller`.
    * get a response of the system with `[y, u] = get_response(arduino, w, n_samples)` where `y` are the measurements and `u` is the system input (generated by the controller).
